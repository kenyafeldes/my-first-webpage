  <h1>My Favorite Places</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Place #1: Sudeley Castle</h2> 
  <h3>Location: Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, England</h3>
    <p>I visited this castle with my mom in 2019. We had always wanted to explore the Cotswolds in England, and this ended up being my favorite place there.</p>

  <h2>Place #2: Crystal Springs Rhododendron Garden</h2>
  <h3>Location: Portland, Oregon</h3>
    <p>In my opinion, this is the most lovely place to take a walk in Portland.</p>
